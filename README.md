# Networking Journal

This is my personal networking log — a mix of study notes, concepts I’ve learned, and practical explanations in my own words. It covers topics like:
- How the internet works
- DNS, NAT, routers, IP addressing
- The OSI Model
- DHCP and subnetting
- TCP/UDP, HTTPS, ports, and more

The goal is to build deep understanding, not just surface knowledge. 💻🌐
